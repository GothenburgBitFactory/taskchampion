/*!
This module defines the backend storage used by [`Replica`](crate::Replica).

It defines a [trait](crate::storage::Storage) for storage implementations, and provides a default
on-disk implementation as well as an in-memory implementation for testing.

Typical uses of this crate do not interact directly with this module. However, users who wish to
implement their own storage backends can implement the traits defined here and pass the result to
[`Replica`](crate::Replica).
