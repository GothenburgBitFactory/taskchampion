This crate implements the core of TaskChampion, the [replica](crate::Replica).

Users of this crate can manipulate a task database using this API, including synchronizing that task database with others via a synchronization server.

Example uses of this crate:
 * user interfaces for task management, such as mobile apps, web apps, or command-line interfaces
 * integrations for task management, such as synchronization with ticket-tracking systems or
   request forms.

# Replica

A TaskChampion replica is a local copy of a user's task data.  As the name suggests, several
replicas of the same data can exist (such as on a user's laptop and on their phone) and can
synchronize with one another.

Replicas are accessed using the [`Replica`] type.

# Task Storage

Replicas access the task database via a [storage object](crate::storage::Storage).

The [`storage`] module supports pluggable storage for a replica's data.
An implementation is provided, but users of this crate can provide their own implementation as well.

# Server

Replica synchronization takes place against a server.
Create a server with [`ServerConfig`].

The [`server`] module defines the interface a server must meet.
Several server implementations are included, and users can define their own implementations.

# Example

```rust
# #[cfg(feature = "storage-sqlite")]
# {
# use taskchampion::{storage::AccessMode, ServerConfig, Replica, SqliteStorage};
# use tempfile::TempDir;
# async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
# let taskdb_dir = TempDir::new()?;
# let taskdb_dir = taskdb_dir.path().to_path_buf();
# let server_dir = TempDir::new()?;
# let server_dir = server_dir.path().to_path_buf();
// Create a new Replica, storing data on disk.
let storage = SqliteStorage::new(
  taskdb_dir,
  AccessMode::ReadWrite,
  true,
)?;
let mut replica = Replica::new(storage);

// Set up a local, on-disk server.
let server_config = ServerConfig::Local { server_dir };
let mut server = server_config.into_server().await?;

// Sync to that server.
replica.sync(&mut server, true).await?;
#
# Ok(())
# }
# }
```

# Feature Flags

Support for some optional functionality is controlled by feature flags.

 * `server-aws` - sync to Amazon Web Services
 * `server-gcp` - sync to Google Cloud Platform
 * `server-sync` - sync to the taskchampion-sync-server
 * `sync` - enables all of the sync features above
 * `bundled` - activates bundling system libraries like sqlite
 * `tls-native-roots` - use native (system) TLS roots, instead of those bundled with rustls, by
   (indirectly) enabling the `rustls` feature `rustls-tls-native-roots`.

 By default, `sync` and `bundled` are enabled.
